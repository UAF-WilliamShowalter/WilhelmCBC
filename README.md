WilhelmCBC
==========

Chaining Block Cipher Feistel type encryption program for my Cryptography class.

Note: The core cryptographic code of WilhelmCBC was adapted into the project WilhelmSCP, which encrypts files for copy over the network.

WilhelmSCP contains many bug fixes to the code that WilhelmCBC was not updated for. Both WilhelmSCP and WilhelmCBC were class projects that explored implementing cryptographic methods and the inherinet difficulty in such tasks. I hope to come back and work on refactoring and updating the code in WilhelmCBC during Spring 2015, but as these were proof-of-concept exercises and not practical projects I may or may not end up doing so.
